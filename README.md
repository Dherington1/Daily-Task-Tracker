## Description
This application was created to help users keep track of their daily tasks. 


## Local Storage
Uses JavaScript localStorage to save all of the the data â€“ which is contained inside of a JSON object. The data is automatically saved everytime you perform an action inside the web app. This means you can leave or refresh the page at anytime, and you will not loose any data without explicitly dumping the data yourself.
